    "Let's now focus on how to handle and maintain chat history in the question and answer (Q&A) application to make conversations flow more naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simplified explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateful Management of Chat History**: Instead of manually entering previous parts of the conversation every time a new input is made, the application can automatically manage and update chat history. This means that the application remembers past interactions and uses that information to understand and respond to new questions more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools for Managing Chat History**:\n",
    "   - **BaseChatMessageHistory**: This component is responsible for storing the history of the conversation.\n",
    "   - **RunnableWithMessageHistory**: This acts as a wrapper around the main processing chain (LCEL chain) and the chat history storage (BaseChatMessageHistory). It takes care of adding the historical chat data to new inputs and updating the stored history after each response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How It Works**: When you use these components in an application:\n",
    "   - The application automatically retrieves and updates the chat history every time it processes a new input. This helps in maintaining a continuous and coherent conversation flow.\n",
    "   - When using `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, it manages chat history using a configuration that includes a unique session identifier (`session_id`). This identifier helps the system know which conversation history to retrieve and update whenever a user interacts with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative ways to store the chat history**: In our simple implementation, chat histories might be stored in a basic dictionary. More complex systems might use databases like Redis to ensure more reliable and long-term storage of conversation data."
